I am an Associate Professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucr.edu/) at the University of California, Riverside, where I am also a cooperating faculty member in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) department. My research broadly focuses on <a href="/publications/">responsible AI</a> 
for building a **resilient, sustainable and equitable** future. More concretely, I am interested in two complementary directions: (1) developing foundational algorithms and empirical methodologies to make networked AI/computing systems more sustainable and equitable; and 
(2) leveraging AI and computational techniques to make our networked society more sustainable and equitable.
 I received the 2015 NSF CAREER award and Best Paper awards from multiple conferences (including the ACM e-Energy'16, the flagship conference of the [ACM SIG on Energy Systems and Informatics](https://energy.acm.org/)) for my research on computational sustainability. 

 I publish my research in various conferences, including [SIGMETRICS](https://www.sigmetrics.org/),
 [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/), and [ASPLOS](https://www.asplos-conference.org/). I have also writen semitechnical articles for multiple magzines and organizations such as the [OECD AI Policy Observatory](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oecd-ai_how-much-water-does-ai-consume-the-public-activity-7135961877473325056-QMM5). Occasionally, I speak about my research on media outlets and public platforms such as [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/06/water-why-a-thirsty-generative-ai-boom-poses-a-problem-for-big-tech.html) and [TED AI](https://tedai-vienna.ted.com/) in Vienna (TED's special event dedicated to AI in Europe). I currently serve
 on the steering committee of the [US Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)](https://www.csis.org/programs/global-food-and-water-security-program) Project for Water Security.



My research on socially and environmentally responsible AI has pushed forward the field
and generated **[broader  impacts](/impacts/)** in various ways, including:

- **Informing AI policies and ethics:** Featured in the **[United Nations <span style="font-weight:lighter;">World Water Development Report 2024</span>](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000388948)** (Chapter 10.1 "Science, Technology and Innovation") and **[International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-scientific-report-on-the-safety-of-advanced-ai)** (commisioned by the UK government), and included in AI ethics and governance guidance
