I am an Associate Professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucr.edu/) at the University of California, Riverside, where I am also a cooperating faculty member in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) department. My research broadly focuses on <a href="/publications/">responsible AI</a> 
for building a **sustainable and equitable future**. More concretely, I am interested in two complementary directions: (1) developing foundational algorithms and empirical methodologies to make networked AI/computing systems more sustainable and equitable; and 
(2) leveraging AI and computational techniques to make our networked society more sustainable and equitable.
 I received the 2015 NSF CAREER award and Best Paper awards from multiple conferences (including the ACM e-Energy'16, the flagship conference of the [ACM SIG on Energy Systems and Informatics](https://energy.acm.org/)) for my research on computational sustainability. 


My research on socially and environmentally responsible AI has pushed forward the field
and generated broader <a href="/impacts/">societal impacts</a> in various ways, including
informing AI policies and ethics (e.g., included in AI usage and governance guidance
of **[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2024/02/10417786/1Ua1B1ZYCR2)**, **[World Health Organization](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/375579/9789240084759-eng.pdf)**, **[The Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/guide-use-generative-ai.html)**, and **[Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2024-02/Exploring-Impact-AI-Black-Americans.pdf)**),
advancing K-12 education (e.g., included in international/U.S. high-school courses of
[Financial Times for School](https://www.ft.com/content/a5a20823-d26f-4701-8afa-18a46a2eea98) offering
access to nearly 5,000 schools worldwide, and in course materials selected by [AI for Education](https://www.aiforeducation.io/ai-resources/ais-impact-on-the-environment)),
impacting industries (e.g., leading to the industry's first
real-time [water footprint reporting](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greenpixie_greenpixie-is-proud-to-include-water-consumption-activity-7155581411104604160-7W1_/) tool for computing systems, and influencing the [ISO/IEC international standard](https://www.iec.ch/blog/importance-sustainable-ai) on sustainable AI), and
fostering public awareness of responsible AI (e.g., through coverage
by ~1,000 major news outlets in ~100 countries such as **[The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-gpt4-iowa-ai-water-consumption-microsoft-f551fde98083d17a7e8d904f8be822c4)**,
**[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-can-make-companies-greener-but-it-also-guzzles-energy-7c7b678)**,
and **[Nature Briefing](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03768-y)**).






**To prospective students:** I have multiple openings available for graduate students with full financial support (in either [ECE](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) or
[CSE](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) department). 
Students with interests in AI + sustainability, networks, optimization, machine learning, or other relevant areas
are welcome to contact me.
