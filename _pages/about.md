I am an Associate Professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucr.edu/) at the University of California, Riverside, where I am also a cooperating faculty member in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) department. My research strives to build
a **sustainable and equitable network of systems**, broadly focusing on <a href='/publications/'>AI + Sustainability</a>. More concretely, I am interested in two complementary directions: (1) developing foundational algorithms and empirical methodologies to make AI and networked computing systems more sustainable; and (2) leveraging AI and computational techniques to make our networked society more sustainable and equitable. I received the 2015 NSF CAREER award and Best Paper awards from multiple conferences (including the ACM e-Energy'16, flagship conference of the [ACM SIG on Energy Systems and Informatics](https://energy.acm.org/)) for my research on computational sustainability.



**To prospective students:** I have multiple openings available for graduate students with full financial support (in either [ECE](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) or
[CSE](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) department). 
Students with interests in AI + sustainability, networks, optimization, machine learning, or other relevant areas
are welcome to contact me.
