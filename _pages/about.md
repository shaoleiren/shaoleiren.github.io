I am an Associate Professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucr.edu/) at the University of California, Riverside, where I am also a cooperating faculty member in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) department. My research focuses on **<a href="/publications/">responsible AI</a>** 
for a resilient, sustainable and equitable future. 

I am broadly interested in advancing AI's **social and environmental responsibility** to serve and benefit society in an ethical manner, including building AI systems with minimum resource usage and environmental costs
on society (especially in capacity constrained communities grappling with energy and climate change challenges)
and safeguarding
AI for equitable and robust deployment in high-stakes environments. Towards this goal, I study both algorithmic foundations and empirical methodologies, centered on:


- **<span style="color:darkred;">Sustainable AI:</span>** Developing principled methodologies to measure and minimize AI's resource usage and lifecyle environmental footprint (**[Communications of the ACM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03271), [e-Energy'24a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17469), [e-Energy'24b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03615), [ASPLOS'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3620665.3640374), [SIGMETRICS'22a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01203)，
[OECD AI <span style="font-weight:lighter;color:darkred;">(perspective article)</span>](https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/how-much-water-does-ai-consume)**)

- **<span style="color:darkred;">Safe decision-making:</span>** Robustifying machine learning predictions in highly dyanmic, uncertain, and/or adversarial environments such as renewable-powered computing systems (**[SIGEMETRICS'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04340), [NeurIPS'23a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01568), [NeurIPS'23b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20098), [ICML'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00172), [ICLR'24](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=e2YOVTenU9), [SIGMETRICS'22b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08572)**) 

- **<span style="color:darkred;">Algorithmic fairness:</span>** Building equitable AI to tackle societal challenges such as sustainability and climage change (**[ICML'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02790), [e-Energy'24c](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05494), [Harvard Business Review <span style="font-weight:lighter;color:darkred;">(perspective article)</span>](https://hbr.org/2024/07/the-uneven-distribution-of-ais-environmental-impacts)**)



 I received the 2015 NSF CAREER award and paper awards from multiple conferences, including ACM e-Energy 2024 and 2016, the flagship conference of the [ACM SIG on Energy Systems and Informatics](https://energy.acm.org/), for my research on computational sustainability. 
 I have also writen semitechnical articles for multiple magzines and organizations such as [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2024/07/the-uneven-distribution-of-ais-environmental-impacts) and
  [OECD AI Policy Observatory](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oecd-ai_how-much-water-does-ai-consume-the-public-activity-7135961877473325056-QMM5). Occasionally, I share my research findings on policy forums, public events and media/television,
   such as expert panels organized by
   [UN Environment Programme](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2024/07/08/professor-joins-un-panel-environmental-impacts-ai), [TED AI](https://tedai-vienna.ted.com/) in Europe (the first TED AI conference in Europe),  [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/tech/novel-ideas-to-cool-data-centers-liquid-in-pipes-or-a-dunking-bath-cdb7a393), CNBC ([one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHk3zE5xh4), [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQIQJYxey4)), LA Times ([one](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-08-12/california-data-centers-could-derail-clean-energy-goals), [two](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-08-15/editorial-generative-ai-is-a-leading-contributor-to-our-energy-consumption-how-will-this-impact-our-climate),
   [three](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-08-26/tech-firms-conceal-water-and-power-demands-of-ai-computing)) and [NPR](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5059073:nx-s1-dd125ecf-65a2-40d5-89e2-e5ca568238c5). I currently serve
 on the steering committee of the [US Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)](https://www.csis.org/programs/global-food-and-water-security-program) Project for Water Security.
