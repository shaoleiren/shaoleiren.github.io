I am an Associate Professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucr.edu/) at the University of California, Riverside, where I am also a cooperating faculty member in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) department. My research broadly focuses on **<a href='/research/'>AI + Sustainability</a>**, with the goal of `building an environmentally sustainable and equitable future`. More concretely, I am interested in: (1) developing foundational algorithms and methodologies to make AI and computing systems more sustainable; and (2) leveraging AI and computational techniques to make our society more sustainable and equitable. I received the 2015 NSF CAREER award and Best Paper awards from multiple conferences (including the ACM e-Energy'16, flagship conference of the [ACM SIG on Energy Systems and Informatics](https://energy.acm.org/)) for my research on computatutational sustainability.


**Prospective Students:** I have multiple openings available for graduate students with full financial support (in either [ECE](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) or
[CSE](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) department). 
Students with interests in AI + sustainability, optimization, machine learning, or other relevant areas
are welcome to contact me.
