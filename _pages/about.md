I am an Associate Professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucr.edu/) at the University of California, Riverside, where I am also a cooperating faculty member in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www1.cs.ucr.edu/) department. My research broadly focuses on **<a href="/publications/">AI, systems, and society</a>**, striving to build
 a resilient, safe and healthy future. 
Towards this goal, I study both algorithmic foundations and empirical methodologies, centered on:


- **<span style="color:darkred;">Reliable AI-augmented decision making:</span>** Infusing domain knowledge to robustify machine learning predictions for reliable decision making in highly dynamic, uncertain, and/or adversarial environments (**[SIGMETRICS'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10158), [SIGMETRICS'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04340),  [NeurIPS'24a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04204), 
[NeurIPS'23a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01568), [NeurIPS'23b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20098), [ICML'23a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00172), [ICLR'24](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=e2YOVTenU9), [SIGMETRICS'22b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08572)**) 

- **<span style="color:darkred;">Health-informed AI:</span>** Quantifying and minimizing
the public health impact of AI data centers and leveraing AI to improve public health (**[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-centers-pollution)**, **[Federation of American Scientists](https://fas.org/publication/advance-ai-with-cleaner-air-and-healthier-outcomes/)**). Please
check out our new paper "**[The Unpaid Toll: Quantifying the Public Health Impact of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06288)**''. More results will be posted soon!


- **<span style="color:darkred;">Efficient AI:</span>** Developing principled methodologies to measure and minimize AI's resource usage and lifecycle footprint (**[Communications of the ACM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03271), [e-Energy'24a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17469), [e-Energy'24b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03615), [ASPLOS'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3620665.3640374), [SIGMETRICS'22a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01203), [CPAL'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14075), [DAC'22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09680), [tinyML'22](https://cms.tinyml.org/wp-content/uploads/talks2022/2203.04894.pdf),
 [OECD AI <span style="font-weight:lighter;color:darkred;">(perspective article)</span>](https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/how-much-water-does-ai-consume)**)

- **<span style="color:darkred;">Safe AI:</span>** Safeguarding AI from malicious and adversarial exploitation
(**[NeurIPS'24b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01946), [ICLR'24](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=e2YOVTenU9), [ICML'23b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00097), [ICCAD'22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08569)**)


- **<span style="color:darkred;">AI fairness:</span>** Building responsible AI to tackle societal challenges (**[ICML'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02790), [Communications of the ACM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16539), [e-Energy'24c](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05494), [Harvard Business Review <span style="font-weight:lighter;color:darkred;">(perspective article)</span>](https://hbr.org/2024/07/the-uneven-distribution-of-ais-environmental-impacts)**)



 I received the 2015 NSF CAREER award and paper awards from multiple conferences, including ACM e-Energy 2024 and 2016, the flagship conference of the [ACM SIG on Energy Systems and Informatics](https://energy.acm.org/), for my research on computational sustainability. 
 I have also writen semitechnical articles for multiple magzines and organizations such as [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2024/07/the-uneven-distribution-of-ais-environmental-impacts) and
  [OECD AI Policy Observatory](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oecd-ai_how-much-water-does-ai-consume-the-public-activity-7135961877473325056-QMM5). Occasionally, I share my research findings on policy forums, public events and media,
   such as expert panels organized by
   [UN Trade and Development](https://unctad.org/meeting/intergovernmental-group-experts-e-commerce-and-digital-economy-8th-session),
   [UN Environment Programme](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2024/07/08/professor-joins-un-panel-environmental-impacts-ai), 
   [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116287/ai-data-centers-nevada-water-reno-computing-environmental-impact/),
   WSJ ([one](https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/ai-electricity-water-environmental-impact-59520a43), [two](https://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-can-make-companies-greener-but-it-also-guzzles-energy-7c7b678)), CNBC ([one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGHk3zE5xh4), [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJQIQJYxey4)),  [Politico](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/the-long-game/2024/10/22/ai-and-the-growing-power-struggle-00184827),
   [NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1249592906), and
   [BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0C56yqIkbk). I was a speaker at [TED AI Vienna](https://www.ted.com/talks/shaolei_ren_ai_consumes_a_lot_of_water_but_why), Europe's first TED conference on AI. I currently serve on the steering committee of the [US Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)](https://www.csis.org/programs/global-food-and-water-security-program) Project for Water Security.
